# Form_Creation-2.2
# Conditional Logic:

# When "Speaker" is selected in the dropdown, additional fields (e.g., Presentation Title) appear using JavaScript (toggleFields function).
# These fields are hidden if "Participant" is selected.
# Thank-You Page:

# On form submission, the form hides and a thank-you message is displayed using JavaScript (showThankYou function).
# Responsive Design:

# The CSS ensures the form looks clean and adapts to different screen sizes.
# Steps to Use:
# Save the index.html and styles.css files in the same folder.
# Open the index.html file in your browser to see the form.
# Test the dropdown to ensure fields show/hide correctly.
# Submit the form to see the thank-you page.
